title: Dimensionality Reduction
---

## Linear Projection
- principal component analysis (PCA)
- singular value decomposition
- random projection

## Manifold Learning
This is also knon as nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
- isomap
- multidimensional scaling (MDS) - good for visualization
- locally linear embedding (LLE)
- t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
  - [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html)
  - good for visualization
- dictionary learning
- random trees embedding
- independent component analysis
