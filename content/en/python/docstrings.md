# Docstrings
Python docstrings can be written in many different formats. An overview
of different methods can be found in the following Stack Overflow entry:
[What is the standard Python docstring
format?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898572/what-is-the-standard-python-docstring-format)

It seems to be clever to use the docstring format of scipy and numpy
since these packages are very popular. A guide to the numpy docstring
format is here: [numpydoc docstring
guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and here is a
[Restructured Text (reST) syntax CheatSheet for
Sphinx](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html).
