Together with [Philipp Reissel](https://twitter.com/phil_ipp_) from [ambeRoad](https://amberoad.de/) I gave a talk about the training and evaluation of our open-source [German Electra NLP language model](https://huggingface.co/german-nlp-group/electra-base-german-uncased).

Here we explain how to train and use language models in general.
We tell what is done differently with our model or the tokenizer than with other models,
explain the composition of our text corpus and illustrate the evaluation and
comparison of the language model.
